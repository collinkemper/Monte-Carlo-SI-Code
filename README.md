# Monte-Carlo-SI-Code
The code accompanying the paper: Rapid Discovery of Functional Sequence-Encoded Magnetically Reconfigurable Microrobots using Monte Carlo Simulations

Please download all of the code and .csv files to work through examples. Work through the code and examples in the .ipynb notebook that utilizes the functions provided in "MC_Tutorial_Functions.py" and the data provided in the csv files. Ensure that all files are downloaded into the same folder.

We recommend use of Visual Studio Code software to run the code included here. Visual Studio Code can be downloaded here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download for MAC, Linux, and Windows

Additionally, please ensure you have python 13.12.3 installed. The link to the installer can be found here https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3123/. Once python is installed, open up Visual Studio code. In the left hand menu, click on the "Extensions" icon. Ensure that both the "Python" and "Jupyter" extensions are downloaded. When running code in the jupyter file, you may get a pop-up notification that mentions installing ipykernal. Click the "install button" if this message appears.

Finally, In the top dropdown menu, click File>>Open Folder>>{folder you have saved all code into}. This should open up the folder as a directory that you can use to run everything.

Thank you
